`gesso` (Gene sEt activity Score analysis with Spatial lOcation) 
is a Python package designed for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics 
expression data at the gene set/pathway level. Given a user-provided gene set/pathway, 
`gesso` computes a gene set activity score (GAS) for each spatial spot in the dataset.
